Unofficial API for building 3rd party software that communicates with ANGEL services.


##Why I'm Making This?
I wish to implement this library into an app that will help keep me organized. Also I wanted to get acquainted with Github and practice good documentation and I figured that this could be of interest to students or even teachers (incorporate this into lessons) at Stark State College.

##Project Mission:
Currently working alone, I plan to write a python module (at first piggybacking off of requests) that will serve as an unofficial API for build 3rd party applications that can communicate with school systems powered by [ANGEL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANGEL_Learning). My endgame plan is to translate this into Java (using socket connections)/Javascript(xmlhttprequests) for web-based or android development. Naturally as I attend Stark State College, at first I'm writing this just for working with SSC's servers, however I plan on making it work regardless of school.
